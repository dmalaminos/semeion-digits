# semeion-digits

Handwritten digit classification (machine learning approach)

Machine Learning (Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona - UPC) - Fall 2014


This project was carried out in teamwork with R. Fernández and F. Bosch. Our task consisted in analyzing the dataset and extracting new useful and discriminant variables, _features_; then, modeling the data with different techniques using a 5x2CV resampling method, and finally choosing and discussing the effectivity of our best model.

We managed to achieve a generalization error of 96.12% using Support Vector Machines.


The original dataset is available from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: [Semeion Handwritten Digit Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit)
